## What? ðŸ¤”
It is not a custom TabLayout or RecyclerView. It is just a helper library to attach to your RecyclerView with your TabLayout. If you don't want to go with sticker header RecyclerView or something like that, and also want to provide a good experience when user scrolling, this small library is for you.

## How? ðŸ¤¨

You fetches your product list and their categories. All you need to do is calcualate start index for all categories. Attacher will do the rest.

If your backend guy returns this json,

CategoryA -> 10 items (between 0..10)
CategoryB -> 20 items (between 10..30)
CategoryC -> 30 items (between 30..60)

Then your offset list will be,

```kotlin
val categoryIndexOffsetList = [0,10,30]
```

## Then? ðŸ™„

Then you attach.
```kotlin
TabScrollAttacher(tabLayout, recyclerView, categoryIndexOffsetList)
```

## Where? ðŸ¤©

```gradle
maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
```

```gradle
dependencies {
  compile 'com.github.iammert:TabScrollAttacher:1.0.0'
}
```

## When? ðŸ˜‡

When you have LinearLayoutManager, GridLayoutManager in any orientation (horizontal or vertical) you can use this library.
